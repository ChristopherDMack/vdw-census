# VDW Census

SAS programs to download and create files to the [HCSRN](http://www.hcsrn.org) VDW Census Demographics specifications.

Full specifications can be found in the [HCSRN document library](https://www.hcsrn.org/share/page/site/VDW/documentlibrary#filter=path%7C%2Fdata_documentation%2Fdata_specifications_and_guidelines%2FVDW%2520Specifications%7C&amp;amp;page=1).

Original build by Christopher Mack at KPWHRI with extensive work by David Tabano, formerly at KPCO.
Still more work to update to the new 2017 ACS file releases.

Please feel free to make a pull request to offer improvements!
